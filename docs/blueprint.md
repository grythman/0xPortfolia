## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A sophisticated, muted emerald green (#2EA07D) reflecting growth and expertise, used for key interactive elements.
- Background color: A deep, subtly verdant tone (#1A2522), providing a rich and calming canvas that complements the animated gradient.
- Accent color: A vibrant, bright mint green (#61E9C0), serving as a refreshing highlight for interactions and subtle visual cues.
- Specific button text color: A dark, saturated forest green (#0D4A3E) for solid buttons to ensure strong contrast against a white background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its clean, modern, and highly legible characteristics, ensuring excellent readability across all content.
- Stylized social media icons with subtle circular backgrounds or glows, and a distinct globe icon for the language toggle, all maintaining a premium, technical aesthetic.
- Glassmorphism elements feature prominent backdrop-filter blurring, distinct borders (e.g., `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`), rounded corners, and consistent box-shadows to emphasize depth and transparency.
- Main container set at 90vw width and 90vh height, centrally positioned, creating a visually enclosed space for all content to float above the animated background.
- Responsive Flexbox and Grid layouts will be used to ensure clean, minimal spacing and optimal presentation across different screen sizes, adhering to modern web design practices.
- While the core animated background is Three.js-driven, subtle hover and focus animations on navigation links and buttons will provide polished feedback, complementing the overall dynamic visual experience.
